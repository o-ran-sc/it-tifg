    MPInterfaceSimulator manages the lifecycle and operations of a simulator service.

    Provides functionalities to start, stop, collect logs, and check the readiness of
    a simulator service running in a Docker Compose environment. It relies on environment
    variables to configure its behavior, such as the path to the Docker Compose file,
    the service name, and the waiting time for the simulator to become ready.
